# Corporate Carpooling

Corporate Carpooling is a web-based application with the purpose of enabling corporations to setup an internal carpooling system. The system helps potential carpoolers find an existing carpool to join, or to create their own for others to join.

The application has a Node.js backend, with an Angular.js frontend, utilizing Bootstrap.

This is a Portland State University capstone project -- sponsored by [NAVEX Global](http://www.navexglobal.com/), released under the MIT license.
